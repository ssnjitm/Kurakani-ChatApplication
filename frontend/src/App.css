/* All professional UI/UX styles should use Tailwind and DaisyUI utility classes directly in your React components.
   Example: <div className="bg-base-100 rounded-xl shadow-card p-8 text-base-content"> ... </div>
   This ensures a modern, cohesive, and theme-driven design. No custom CSS needed here. */
